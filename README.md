- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gpundt
- I am a student at RIT studying Cyber Security.
- This GitHub contains personal projects such as games, class assignments, practice exercises, scripts, etc.
- My aim is to grow as a programmer, keep track of my progress, and to use all of these files as references in the future.
